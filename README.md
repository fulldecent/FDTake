What you do
----------------
 1. Make a `FDTakeController` and call `- (void)takePhotoOrChooseFromLibrary`<br>
 2. Implement `FDTakeDelegate` and handle `- (void)takeController:(FDTakeController *)controller gotPhoto:(UIImage *)photo withInfo:(NSDictionary *)info`
 3. Implement anything else you want in <a href="https://github.com/fulldecent/FDTake/blob/master/FDTakeExample/FDTakeController.h">`FDTakeController.h`</a>

What we do
----------------

 2. Create action sheet with appropriate options ("Take Photo" or "Choose from Library"), as available
 3. Localize "Take Photo" and "Choose from Library" into user's language
 4. Wait for response
 5. Bring up image picker with selected image picking method
 6. Get response, extract image from a dictionary
